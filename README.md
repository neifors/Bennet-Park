### Rapid Prototyping (2hr sprint)
*0:05 - 0:10* // Get a random subject courtesy of [WikiRoulette](http://wikiroulette.co/) \
*0:10 - 0:20* // Read Wiki and do additional research for content \
*0:20 - 0:45* // Design. No code. Use any tools you wish - pen & paper, Figma, wireframe.cc, MS Paint...! \
*0:45 - 0:50* // Stand & Stretch \
*0:50 - 1:50* // Code! We are not aiming for perfection. \
*1:50 - 2:00* // Deploy to production and prepare presentation

After the sprint there will be a 30 minute buffer period designed for taking a breather. If you like you may spend some of this time practising the presentation - make it slick, engaging and informative! Slides optional but always appreciated!

**Presentations** will be short (***2-4 mins + 1 min for Q&A***)

Weâ€™re interested in seeing a live demo of your site and hearing your answers to the following 6 questions:
- What is your topic? Share a top interesting fact.
- What tools did you use for planning?
- What tools did you use for executing?
- What was your biggest challenge?
- What was your biggest win?
- In retrospect, what, if anything, would you do differently?
